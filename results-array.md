In direct comparison of methylation for an individual oyster prior to and following heat shock approximately 10k differentially methylated features were identified.  For all oysters a majority of the features were hypomethylated. Specifically, for oysters #2, #4, and #6 the number of hypomethylated features was 7224, 6560, and 7645, respectively. 

In order to examine regions that were differentially methylated across all three oysters features were identified where there were at least 3 adjacent probes with signficantly differentially methylated. A total of 362 features were identified as hypomethylated and 164 features as hypermethylated.
