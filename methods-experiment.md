#Methods-experiment


notes     

Sampled 13 oysters for pre-stress epigenetic analyses.  In two plastic tanks filled with 6L, dissolved 300g of MgCl2 in each tank and left oysters in the solution overnight (3/11).  In the morning (3/12) sampled 13 oysters for DNA and RNA.  These tissues were put on dry ice and placed in the -80 freezer until further processing.

Tomorrow will sample the additional 10 oysters left.  I decided to break the sampling up into two days since 23 oysters were too many to process at once.  After anesthetization the oysters only stay open for a minute or two so it would be too difficult to sample all oysters at once.  

Will hopefully do heat shock experiment later this week or early next week.

Sampled remaining 10 oysters for DNA and RNA tissues.  Placed oysters in net bags in Kristian's tanks until early next week when I will complete the heat shock experiment.  


Total number of oysters=23
Oyster samples that didn't open: oyster #1, 3, 19, 20
Total number of oysters sampled=19

Sampled oysters that didn't open (#1, 3, 19, 20) in case we decide to do additional analyses on these samples.  Took DNA and RNA samples from oyster mantle and gill tissue and froze in -80 degree freezer
Measurements for oysters that didn't open:
1) 159.75g, 99cm L, 70.4cm W
3) 197.94g, 120.3cm L, 64.6cm W
19) 251.73g, 122.4cm L, 70.9cm W
20) 105.11g, 79.1cm L, 56.8cm W

3/19/13
Performed heat shock experiment.  Added about 8L of seawater to the water bath in the lab.  Put the remaining 19 oysters in the water bath at 40 degrees C for 1 hour.  Put 9 oysters back into aquarium room and will sample these in 1 week (3/26) and sampled 10 oysters immediately after the heat shock.  Took DNA and RNA samples from oyster mantle and gill tissue and froze in -80 degree freezer.
Measurements for first batch of oysters sampled:
2) 265.18g, 128.7cm L, 86.5cm W
4) 182.80g, 129.3 cm L, 73.5cm W
5) 127.82g, 99.3cm L, 64.3cm W

**NOTE: 22+23- not sure which is which since labels came off!
